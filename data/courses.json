The course will be grounded in the analysis of cinema (feature films, documentaries, avant-garde, and animation) with special focus on film style and storytelling techniques.

        "courseDescription": "The purpose of the course is to gain a theoretical understanding of the ways moving images and sounds communicate, and practical experience creating time-based work. We will study texts on theories of moving images and examine examples as we use cameras, sound recorders, and non-linear editing software to produce a series of short exercises that require organizing images and sounds in ways that convey information and express feelings.",

        "courseDescription": "Documentary film combines nonfiction with an aesthetic aspiration. This course will explore the achievement in the documentary, raising issues about the influence of documentary upon political persuasion, historical memory, the status of film as evidence, and its utility as a means of investigation. Questions will be posed, such as: Can documentary achieve a distinctive understanding of a phenomenon? How does nonfiction address/guide the relationship between sound, image, and subject? The course will offer a historical perspective, as well as study contemporary works, with the aim of preparing students to both understand and produce documentary films.",

Through rigorous analysis of existing media, we will understand the dramatic and interpretative choices made by film writers, directors, and editors. Through hands-on exercises, we will develop scene analysis techniques, rehearsal methodologies, and pre-visualization strategies.",

        "courseDescription": "Digital video technologies—such as DVDs, digital editing software, and online streaming—now enable film and media scholars to “write” with the same materials that constitute their object of study: moving images and sounds. But such a change means rethinking the rhetorical modes traditionally used in scholarly writing, and incorporating more aesthetic and poetic elements alongside explanation and analysis. In this hands-on course, we will both study and produce new videographic forms of criticism often known as “video essays,” exploring how such work can both produce knowledge and create an aesthetic impact.",

Throughout the semester we will develop film scripts, floor plans, shot lists and storyboards. We will cast actors, hold rehearsals and conduct interviews. We will discuss works in progress, discuss the short film form and constantly edit our ideas until they are compact, emotional and meaningful. We will work collaboratively on a group project and individually on each of our own films. And we will share our best work in a public screening at the end of the semester.",
